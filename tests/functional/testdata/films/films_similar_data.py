        "title": "Afghan Star",
        "description": '"Afghan Star" is a TV show modeled on the UK\'s "Pop Idol." We join the 2008 contest when it\'s down to nine contestants, and we focus on two women, Setara and Lema, and two men, Hameed and Rafi. We watch the two women in particular: Satara sings with emotion and includes dance in her final performance, an action that puts her life in danger; Lema is traditional, but her very appearance brings death threats. The three finalists are from different tribes, and each makes a plea for Afghan unity. The camera visits families watching the competition, there are comments from people in the street, and we return home with a nervous Setara. In Afghanistan, singing is an expression of freedom.',

        "description": 'Direct from Brazil in his last recorded performance, Antonio Carlos Jobim (1927-1994) is joined by an international delegation of jazz giants to recreate his classic melodies in a beautiful, concert-length "Thank You." With over four hundred songs to his credit, including the unforgettable "Girl From Ipanema," Jobim virtually singlehandedly brought the world the Bossa Nova. Adapting the percussive excitement of the Samba to the intimacy of the guitar while echoing the melodies and harmonies of Cool Jazz, Jobim\'s new sound quickly became a staple ingredient in the jazz cookbook, and in 1991 Jobim was inducted into the Songwriter\'s Hall of Fame.',
